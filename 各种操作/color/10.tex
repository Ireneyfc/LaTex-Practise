% Set the document class to "article"
% Pass it "letterpaper" option
\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}

% We don't need the special font encodings, but still
% good practice to include these. See:

% Colours -- see xcolor documentation for more details

% Define indigo as a custom colour

\begin{document}

% Making the text bold so it's easier to see the colours
\textbf{
\red{Richard} \orange{Of} \yellow{York} \green{Gave} \blue{Battle} \indigo{In}
\violet{Vain}
}

\red{Using a macro} is much easier than \textcolor{red}{directly using the
command}, or the {\color{red}other direct way}.

We can even use background colours: \redbg{R}\orangebg{o}\yellowbg{y}
\greenbg{G}. \bluebg{B}\indigobg{i}\violetbg{v}

\end{document}
